Flink Library
============
This module contains various libraries for Apache Flink.

It is currently being developed and is experimental so should not yet be used.

In order to make use of the flink libraries you will need to include these libraries as a dependency:

```
 <dependency>
  <groupId>uk.gov.gchq.gaffer</groupId>
  <artifactId>flink-library</artifactId>
  <version>${gaffer.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

You will then need to register the flink operations and their handlers with your store.
You just need to add the following to your store properties file.
```
gaffer.store.operation.declarations=flinkOperationsDeclarations.json
```
